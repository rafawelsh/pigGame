This Pig Game is a simple game where 2 players roll the dice and try to accumulate 100 points.

When a player rolls the die, they will accumulate the points on a queue. Once they press 'Hold' will the points be added to their total points towards the 100.

If the player rolls a 1, they lose their turn and the next player rolls.

HAVE FUN!
